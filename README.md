# Smart-Pill-Box-Using-Medicine-Reminder
This project is based on IOT in which we have used Arduino-uno and jumper wires, push buttons and the most essential RTC3231 (real time clock)and bread board and led lights,and 16 x 2  lcd display
This paper proposes a smart pillbox system with remind and consumption function which is used to give alerts to the user to take pills at the scheduled time. 
 Smart  pill box can reduce the guardianâ€™s responsibility of giving the correct medicines at the prescribed time.
 In day to day life, people face trouble remembering the pills that need to be consumed. Many times the problem is that the time required to take the medicine is not printed on the  packaging of medicine. People also have a habit of forgetting to take pills. Sometimes medicines go beyond their expiry date.
 So this will help those people to takecare of themself.
